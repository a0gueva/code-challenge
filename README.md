# code-challenge

On this repo you will find an index.html file.  This file contains the startup source for the challenge. 
This is a functioning application.  Everything necessary to complete this challenge is already built into
the <b>index.html</b> file.

What you have to do is the following

<ul>
<li>1.) clone the repository.</li>
<li>2.) Startup a local server to run the code you can use (python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000)</li>
<li>3.) See below for instructions.
to what is expected.</li>
<li>4.) Do not check the code into master but instead create your own branch and when you're ready with
your changes put a PR together for them. 
</ul>

Take a look at how the code is structured.

This application uses firebase from google to hold he data that will be used on this application.  You can find the
data models here https://console.firebase.google.com/project/pdp-builder/database/pdp-builder/data/

Note: The application starts out showing a default product.  Clicking on a different swatch refreshes the data on the page
but does not refresh the data.  You will need to create the click handlers to accomodate that functionality.  You must
also crate the logic to refresh the different parts of the product page as described in the Instructions below.
